# Welcome to my Curses GUI GitHub Page!

## About This Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository for a Linux System Administration tool using Python and the `curses` GUI library. This project aims to simplify and streamline various administrative tasks through a text-based user interface, inspired by tools like `nmtui`.

## What is `curses`?

The `curses` library provides a way to create text-based user interfaces within a terminal window. It allows for the creation of interactive and visually structured applications without the need for a graphical environment. This can be particularly useful for system administrators who often work in terminal-only environments, such as SSH sessions on remote servers.

### Key Features of `curses`:

- **Text-based GUI**: Build interactive user interfaces that run in the terminal.
- **Cross-platform**: Available on many Unix-like systems, including Linux.
- **Efficient**: Lightweight and does not require a graphical desktop environment.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly tool for performing common system administration tasks. The initial focus will be on user management, with plans to expand functionality to file system management and beyond.

### Current Features:

- **Create Users**: Easily add new users to the system.
- **Modify Users**: Update existing user information and settings.
- **Delete Users**: Remove users from the system.

### Future Enhancements:

- **File System Management**: Tools for creating and deleting file systems.
- **Network Configuration**: Simplify network setup and management.
- **System Monitoring**: View and manage system resources and processes.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andrewumana76/Linux_System_Admin_GUI.git
    cd Linux_System_Admin_GUI
    ```

2. **Run the Application**:
    Ensure you have Python installed, then install required packages:

    ```bash
    python start_program.py
    ```

This is what you should see when the python script is ran:

Currently functionality is still being added with python and bash scripts.
